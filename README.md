# Project Overview
This project aims to build and optimize a neural network model to predict the success of funding applications received by AlphabetSoup, a fictional charity organization. The project involves preprocessing the data, creating and training the model, optimizing the model, and analyzing the results.

# Requirements

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alphabet-soup-charity.git
cd alphabet-soup-charity
Create and activate a virtual environment:

Running the Project
Data Preprocessing:

The script preprocesses the data by:

Dropping non-beneficial ID columns (EIN, NAME).
Replacing low-frequency categorical values with "Other".
One-hot encoding the categorical variables.
Splitting the data into features (X) and target (y), and further into training and testing sets.
Model Definition:

A Sequential neural network model is created with:

Input layer matching the number of features.
Two hidden layers with ReLU activation.
Output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.
Model Compilation and Training:

The model is compiled using adam optimizer and binary_crossentropy loss function. It is then trained on the training data for 100 epochs.

Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using the test data, and the loss and accuracy metrics are printed.

Model Export:

The trained model is saved to an HDF5 file named AlphabetSoupCharity.h5.

Model Optimization:

Overview of the Analysis

The goal of this analysis was to build a neural network model that could predict the success of organizations funded by Alphabet Soup based on a variety of features. By developing a model with this capability, we aim to help Alphabet Soup make more informed funding decisions and improve the success rate of their investments.

Results

Data Preprocessing:

The target variable for our model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column, which indicates whether a funded organization was successful or not.

The features used for our model include all the columns that provide information about the organizations, except for the ones that are identifiers or not directly related to the outcome.

The columns "EIN" and "NAME" were removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features. They don't contribute to predicting the success of the organizations, so it was better to exclude them.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:

For the neural network model, I chose to start with two hidden layers. The first layer had 80 neurons and used the ReLU activation function. The second layer had 30 neurons, also using the ReLU activation function. These choices were made because ReLU is commonly effective in neural networks, and the number of neurons seemed like a good balance between model complexity and performance.

The output layer used a single neuron with the sigmoid activation function because we're dealing with binary classification, where we need a probability between 0 and 1.

After compiling and training the model, I was able to achieve an accuracy that was reasonable, though not quite at the 75% threshold we were aiming for. I made several attempts to optimize the model by adjusting the number of neurons, adding more layers, and changing the activation functions. Despite these efforts, the model’s performance plateaued below our target.

Optimizing the Model:

To improve the model, I tried several strategies, including increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layers, adding an additional hidden layer, and experimenting with different activation functions. I also adjusted the number of epochs to see if a longer training time would help the model learn better. However, even with these optimizations, the model didn’t quite reach the desired accuracy level.
Summary:

Overall, the neural network model did a decent job of predicting the success of the organizations, but it didn’t hit the accuracy target we set. Despite that, the process of optimization provided valuable insights into how different factors affect the performance of a deep learning model. If I were to approach this problem again, I might consider using a different model, such as a decision tree or a random forest. These models are generally easier to interpret and could potentially handle the categorical nature of the data better than a neural network. They might also provide more insight into which features are most important in determining the success of an organization.
